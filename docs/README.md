# About STRIKE

**STRIKE** is a powerful tool that enables users to **share actionable links** with ease, powered by the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**. With **STRIKE**, anyone can interact with **canisters** (smart contracts) directly from social platforms like **Twitter (X)** by sharing a simple link. These links unfurl into interactive **STRIKE Cards** that allow users to perform predefined actions without the need for complex Web3 development or coding.

STRIKE makes it easy to integrate blockchain-based functionality into everyday interactions, such as **placing bets**, **transferring ownership**, or **retrieving information** from smart contracts, all with the click of a button. The **STRIKE Chrome extension** enhances this experience, allowing users to authenticate and securely engage with canisters directly from their browser.
